    - Clearly restates the original problem.
    - Presents the solution in a concise manner. If the solution includes code or long explanations, include only the critical parts needed for understanding.
    - Optionally, highlight key insights if they are necessary to understand the solution.
    Keep the output as open as possible: use paragraphs, bullet points, or code blocks as needed.
