# Aegis AI

Aegis AI is a **free, unlimited** AI ChatBot that uses various models through [Hack Club's free API](https://ai.hackclub.com).
Aegis AI does **not** sell your user information, and all chat & user data is stored locally, on your device. However, Hack Club does log all API usage.

## Features

- All data is stored locally on your device. No data is stored on the internet (outside of Hack Club's logs).
- Full Markdown Support.
- Support for multiple chats.
- Detailed code-blocks, including syntax highlighting, downloading, and a copy button.
- Customizable with name, occupation, and custom instructions.
- Reasoning is visible.
- For GPT-OSS models, advanced web search is supported with inline citations.

## Todo

- Canvas/Code Panel
- Tree-of-Thought (Multiple instances of the same or different models working together to solve a problem at the same time)
- Incognito mode
- Parameter configuration (temperature, top_p, etc.)
